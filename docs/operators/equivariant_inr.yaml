title: SO(3)-Equivariant INR
domain: reconstruction
input:
  - x
  - t
  - R
output: f_theta(x, t, z)
invariants:
  - rotation
analogy: observation-frame invariance
notes: |
  Draft operator inspired by rotation-equivariant implicit neural representations for cell SDF reconstruction.
  Serves as a bridge between learned INRs and the world-tube operator catalog.
