# Open Questions

## Time-Varying Geometry
- Should geometry be modeled as a true 4D SDF F(x,y,z,t) or keyframes + deformations?

## Operator Catalog Granularity
- How many primitives are enough to cover observed biology?
- When does a residual warrant a new operator vs improved fit?

## Spectral Anchoring Resolution
- How many shells or region samples are required to capture meaningful signal gradients?

## Event Detection Robustness
- How to avoid false positives from noise or transient constrictions?
- What persistence window (time + spatial displacement) is biologically reasonable?

## Compute vs Storage
- Optimal balance between upfront compute for fitting vs long-term storage savings?
