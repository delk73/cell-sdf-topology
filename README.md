# Cell SDF Topology

Skeleton research repo for time-conditioned signed distance fields with topology changes.

- `docs/`: single source of truth for design specs and operator catalogs.
- `meta/prompts/`: provenance prompts subdivided into `init/`, `emit/`, and `audit/`.
- `src/`: staging ground for future Python package code.
- `tests/`: placeholder tests; target Python >=3.11 with `pytest`.
